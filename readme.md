# Overview
The creation of this project follows this fantastic Bevy tutorial series by Zymertu Games on YouTube with my own twist on some details. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6ZFuYYZCSY&list=PL2wAo2qwCxGDp9fzBOTy_kpUTSwM1iWWd

# TODO: 
- [x] Look into [web deployment on github pages](https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/platforms/wasm.html)
- [x] Follow on [tutorial 4](https://youtu.be/pm4LLMsKJQg?si=9BDM8LHQ_XFKPQ4l)
- [ ] Follow on [tutorial 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSuQ-dQSxys)
- [x] Migrate from Bevy 0.15 to 0.16 and use Avian 0.3

# Features TODO:
- [ ] There's a request for levels and bosses.
- [ ] I Want an ammo limit with reloading by eating different foods that the cow can pick up.
- [ ] I want different foods to correspond to different weapons (machine gun, shotgun, low rate explode with sharpnel)
- [ ] I want different baddies. Farmers, cowboys, milkmaids
- [ ] Cow and baddies should have HP and ammo should influence the HP instead of directly despawning.
- [ ] Split screen for 2-4 people to play on the same machine
- [ ] Support for gamepads
- [ ] Spash screen and UI
- [ ] Database to record high scores - half done
- [ ] Support mobile somehow. Not sure what control inputs to use...
- [ ] Add animations (https://github.com/dsgallups/bevy_gltf_animation)

// Notes:
Tutorial series uses Bevy 0.12. I'm using Bevy 0.15 because 0.16 is too new to work with Avian3d. Should use [Bevy migration guides](https://bevyengine.org/learn/migration-guides/introduction) to update when possible.
